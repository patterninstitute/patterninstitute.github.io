You’ll also get a brief introduction to control-flow structures like loops and conditionals, learn how to write simple functions, and explore some of R’s most commonly used built-in functions. The tutorial is divided into seven manageable sections, each with clear objectives and hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning. By the end, you’ll have a solid foundation to start your journey in data analysis with R."

The second package will offer a Shiny-based graphical interface that allows users to explore the same simulation workflows interactively, without writing code.\nRather than building a digital twin of a specific instrument, this platform will serve as a sandbox for training and planning—enabling researchers to ask “what if” questions, test normalization methods, and learn best practices before stepping into the lab.

    "text": "The significance of outreach\nIn addition to my academic pursuits, I value the importance of science outreach and bringing science and knowledge closer to communities. Knowledge is power, and combined with critical thinking these are very useful allies in navigating our world, where misinformation is spreading at alarming rates. This is one of the reasons I am very happy to be member of the Pattern Institute, which is also dedicated to making science more accessible to everyone."
